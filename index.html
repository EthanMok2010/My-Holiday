    <h1>A Meaningful Holiday</h1>
    <h2>Overseas vacation to Perth,Australia</h2>
    <p>
      In September 2017, my parents and I flew to Singapore to spend a night
      there at my uncle’s house. After that, my family and I went to Perth,
      Australia and it was towards end of winter season so the weather was
      very cool. The trip was really fun. We ate lots of nice food and had a
      great experience there. I saw a big statue that was really tall. It also
      has big cities and small villages near the sea. The people that stayed
      in the village near the sea usually go fishing beside their house. I had
      lots of fun and I hope I can go back to Australia.

        <p>
          I like Perth because they have a variety of food and have a lot of
          nice people. The food they serve is delicious. Their seas are very
          clean and huge. They are well-known for their “Perth Zoo” and their
          winery. There are also a lot of special animals like the koala,
          kangaroo and quokka.
